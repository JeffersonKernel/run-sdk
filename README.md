# RUN SDK - 0.6.42 beta

[![tests](https://github.com/runcraft-bitcoin/run-sdk/workflows/tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/runcraft-bitcoin/run-sdk/actions) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/runcraft-bitcoin/run-sdk/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=VPXTBV9CQP)](https://codecov.io/gh/runcraft-bitcoin/run-sdk/)

**Note: This project is only lightly supported with limited ressources for now by the team at https://runcraft.io. Feel free to contribute.**


RUN is a token protocol to build whatever you dream up. A world of interactive apps and tokens.

To give it a go, visit https://wiki.runcraft.io/ for tutorials and docs.

## Versions and migrations

### version 0.6.42

- removes support for Run Connect API which was configured as default and got deprecated. It was replaced with the whatsonchain API as default, be aware that they have rate limits.

**migration guide:** this means you cannot pass "run" as the api config anymore, or you will get an error. Instead you can just remove it to use the default, pass "whatsonchain" or use a custom api of your own.

## Installation

We recommend using `nvm` to have the proper node version. Run-SDK requires Node 16 or higher.
Check with `node --version`, and for example switch with `nvm install 16 && nvm use 16`.

Run `npm install` to install node dependencies.

Then run `npm run build` to build the browser and node libraries.

### Examples

- `env BROWSER=safari npm run test:browser` - Test the browser build on Safari
- `env STRESS=1 npm run test` - Test library with stress tests
- `env NETWORK=test env PURSE=<funded_private_key> npm run test` - Run all tests on testnet

### .env file

For ease of use, you may also store these variables in a `.env` file where the tests are run. Here's a sample:

```
BROWSER=safari
PURSE_MAIN=<your priate key>
PURSE_TEST=<your private key>
APIKEY_WHATSONCHAIN=<your api key>
```
